        "buildingText1": "Constructed in a traditional national style rooted in the architectural masterpieces of ancient cultural centers such as Samarkand, Bukhara, and Khiva, the Art Gallery of Uzbekistan meets all the modern requirements for institutions of this kind.",
        "buildingText2": "This remarkable structure, which has become an integral part of the newly developed ensemble at the heart of Uzbekistan’s capital, incorporates the rich architectural heritage of Uzbek craftsmanship, along with the use of traditional local building materials. The design and construction drew on the experience of leading museums and exhibition halls in Italy, Germany, the UK, the USA, and Russia. This made it possible to build a unique cultural structure, which today has no equal not only in Central Asia but also in any of the CIS countries.",
        "buildingText3": "State-of-the-art equipment ensures the Gallery maintains the strictest standards of temperature, humidity, and security for the proper display and preservation of artworks. The building is equipped with a lecture hall, cinema hall, library, masterclass studio, and workshops, enabling the Gallery to function as a center for art history, research, and restoration, and to host prestigious international exhibitions at a high professional level.",

        "treasuresText1": "The first exhibition at the Fine Arts Gallery features over 300 paintings — some of the finest examples of 20th-century Uzbek visual art. The collection includes works by distinguished artists such as Usto Mumin, U. Tansykbaev, A. Abdullaev, N. Kuzibayev, M. Yuldashev, R. Gagloeva, B. Jalalov, L. Bure, P. Benkov, and emerging artists whose work reflects the life and spirit of today’s Uzbekistan. This exhibition is based on the collection of the National Bank’s Art Gallery, originally founded in 1994.",
        "treasuresText2": "A special highlight of the Gallery’s collection is the",
        "treasuresText3": " numismatic collection ",
        "treasuresText4": "— a true gem of the National Bank’s artistic holdings. It would not be an exaggeration to note that the bank's coin collection can compete in quality with the famous collections of the largest foreign museums, including the British Museum in London. What makes this collection truly exceptional is its focus on locally minted coins, many of which were previously unknown to global historians. The collection includes coins from Sogdiana, Khwarezm, Chach, Ustrushana, as well as from Central Asian governors of the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates, and coins minted during the Timurid dynasty and other regional rulers. Spanning over 2,500 years of history, this collection is a testament to Uzbekistan’s deep cultural and state-building traditions. Thanks to the efforts of the National Bank, hundreds of rare and historically significant coins have been preserved and now stand as a national treasure.",

        "missionTitle": "Gallery Mission",
        "missionText1": "While fulfilling its role as a key financial institution and representing the country on international markets, the National Bank of Uzbekistan has also actively supported the social, cultural, and spiritual life of the Republic. Over the past 20 years, the Bank’s Art Gallery has not only promoted the work of talented Uzbek artists and celebrated the richness of the country’s visual arts, but also played a vital role in preserving cultural heritage. This contribution was personally acknowledged by the First President during his visit to the Fine Arts Gallery. The Bank regularly organizes exhibitions from its collection and curates regional showcases that spotlight the work of local artists. To further promote Uzbekistan’s cultural legacy worldwide, the National Bank publishes art catalogues now housed in museums and galleries across the globe.",
        "missionText2": "While viewing the Gallery’s collection, the President emphasized that spiritual development is one of the cornerstones of modern Uzbekistan. The establishment of a national fine arts gallery demonstrates the Uzbek people’s deep commitment to cultural growth and the preservation and enrichment of their unique artistic and spiritual heritage — essential foundations for the great future awaiting the nation.",

        "coinsFormationTitle": "Forming a Unique Coin Collection",
        "coinsIntro": "The National Bank for Foreign Economic Activity of the Republic of Uzbekistan makes a worthy contribution to the noble cause of preserving the country's historical monuments — its national heritage. Unsurprisingly, due to the nature of its activities, the bank is most interested in numismatic artifacts of the past — coins that circulated in the territory of Uzbekistan over millennia.",
        "coinsText2": "In this regard, it is no exaggeration to state that among the achievements of the National Bank, a notable place belongs to the creation of the first banking collection of ancient coins in the country.",
        "coinsText1": "With the attainment of independence, our country began to actively and purposefully create its own national monetary system. The coins and banknotes of sovereign Uzbekistan are full-fledged instruments of monetary circulation and fully reflect the independent financial policy of our state. Their production incorporates the rich historical and cultural values of our people.",
        "coinsText3": "Forming a collection is a complex and responsible task that requires a proper methodology. Such a methodology has been developed and is successfully applied in building the collection in question. Broadly speaking, this methodology is based on two complementary principles, both derived from the most important one — preserving the national heritage of the country embodied in numismatic artifacts.",
        "coinsText4": "The first priority, of course, is to save and preserve the rarest pieces. The bank’s numismatic collection already includes many unique coins worthy of any museum in the world. However, a collection of rarities alone does not provide a complete picture of the region's monetary history, thus the second principle becomes essential — striving for the most comprehensive and detailed (down to die varieties) representation of monetary circulation in the territory of Uzbekistan.",
        "coinsText5": "Thus, it is no coincidence that as the National Bank’s numismatic collection grows, it becomes increasingly complete and cohesive. Gaps in existing sections are being filled step by step, some coins launch new sections, and rarities evoke special pride and admiration. Quantity is gradually transforming into quality.",
        "coinsHistoricalTitle": "Historical Significance",
        "coinsText6": "The special value of this collection lies in the fact that it mostly consists of regionally minted coins that are almost completely unknown to global academia. Notable examples include coins from Sogd, Khwarezm, Chach, Ustrushana, and coins of the Central Asian governors of the Umayyads and Abbasids, as well as local Muslim dynasties.",
        "coinsText7": "Throughout this vast historical period, the spectrum of currency is remarkably diverse. In addition to the dominant local minting, so-called imported coins also circulated. In ancient times, for Central Asia and Uzbekistan in particular, these were primarily coins of Alexander the Great and China. The collection includes a drachma of Alexander and a copper coin from China issued two thousand years ago. However, the greatest interest is sparked by coins from states that once included parts of modern Uzbekistan — from the Seleucid and Greco-Bactrian rulers to Parthia and the Kushan Empire.",
        "coinsText8": "Particularly notable are the splendid drachmas and copper denominations with highly expressive portraits of ancient Khwarezmian kings. These coins, known to be rare, are prized treasures of the world’s largest numismatic collections. Among medieval coins, the so-called Bukharan Sogd and Chach coins are especially valuable for providing insight into a period barely illuminated by written sources.",
        "coinsText9": "The coins of Central Asian governors of the Umayyads, Abbasids, and Samanids are also of immense significance and rarity. Much research has been written about their historical value, often serving as the sole sources of information on local rulers.",
        "coinsText10": "The Bukhara Emirate is represented mainly by gold coins. The excellently preserved tillas, minted relatively recently by historical standards, sometimes hold mysteries — some bear two different minting dates, others feature rhymed inscriptions, and still others appear in series connected by special symbols yet to be deciphered by scholars.",
        "coinsCulturalTitle": "Cultural Heritage",
        "coinsText11": "It is well known that any collection is more than just a set of items. A true collection — especially one as significant as the National Bank of Uzbekistan's numismatic collection — is above all a reflection of humanity’s eternal striving for knowledge, in this case, knowledge that is worthy of being preserved and passed on to future generations as part of their homeland's great historical legacy."

          "subtitle1": "Exhibition theme: \"The origins of the formation of the national school of fine arts of Uzbekistan in the early 20th century\"",
          "text1": "In the early 20th century, within the context of the overall Europeanization of the region's culture, the development of easel painting in Uzbekistan began as one of the forms of European culture. In the works of visiting Russian artists, mostly graduates of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts—S. Yudin, L. Bure, I. Kazakov, and others—an 'ethnographic' direction developed, portraying Uzbek cities, daily life, material culture, and history primarily as exotic. The fascination of Russian painters with the majestic beauty of architecture and the vivid colors of Eastern life reflected a broader trend: at the turn of the 20th century, European culture as a whole turned its gaze eastward as never before. The traditional East attracted artists with its preserved immediacy and moral purity, harmony with nature, and elevated spiritual traditions. Uzbekistan enriched the palettes of Russian painters and, in the following period, deepened their artistic and conceptual explorations.",
          "text2": "In the 1920s, the formation of the Uzbek national school of painting began. This coincided with a period in European culture when dominant anthropocentrism in art began to collapse. Artists expressed a rejection of the established bourgeois civilization and culture as a whole. They protested against mercantile relationships, the standardization of life, rationalism, hypocrisy, and superficial beauty that masked the real ugliness of reality. Their creative searches favored irrationality over rationality, subjectivity over objectivity. Artists sought new expressive means to reveal the hidden, the secret, and the more meaningful aspects beyond the visible. In this quest, they turned to dissonance in imagery, color, rhythm, and composition. Their experimentation later came to be known as avant-garde. The works of A. Volkov, A. Nikolaev, N. Karakhan, V. Ufimtsev, N. Kashina, O. Tatevosyan, U. Tansykbaev, P. Benkov, V. Eryomen, Z. Kovalevskaya, M. Kurzin, and A. Podkovyrov from the 1920s reflect a distinctive avant-garde style of the highest professional caliber. However, this was an avant-garde rooted in the enduring traditions of Uzbekistan’s centuries-old culture. The reinterpretation of traditional artistic poetics and the spiritual legacy of past centuries is what distinguishes the avant-garde painting of 1920s Uzbekistan as a unique phenomenon of global significance. These artists drew not only from European movements such as Cubism, Expressionism, and Abstractionism, but also from the traditions of historical monumental painting, miniature art, and traditional decorative-applied art of Uzbekistan.",
          "subtitle2": "Exhibition theme: \"Fine art of Uzbekistan in the 1930s–1950s\"",
          "text3": "In the 1930s, with the establishment of the totalitarian regime, the only permitted method—and effectively the only artistic direction—became Socialist Realism, which suppressed the achievements of the preceding decade. A forced breakdown of creative thinking took place, and the concept of artistic freedom was banished from aesthetics. The purpose of art was primitively reduced to serving society. Nevertheless, it would be inaccurate to give a wholly negative assessment of Uzbek art from the 1930s to the 1950s. During this period, genuine masters of art continued to work—A. Volkov, N. Karakhan, N. Kashina, P. Benkov, B. Khamdami, A. Abdullaev, Ch. Akhmarov, Sh. Khasanova, U. Tansykbaev—who tried to circumvent the canons of Socialist aesthetics by emphasizing stylistic elements, embracing national traditions, and seeking to represent individuality during a complex historical era. In the second half of the 1950s, realism gained prominence in Uzbek fine art, invigorated by the creative efforts of academic artists such as R. Akhmedov, N. Kuzybaev, M. Saidov, T. Oganesov, V. Zhmakin, Yu. Elizarov, L. Reznikov, A. Gan, R. Timurov, G. Tkachev, Z. Inogamov, M. Kalantarov, B. Brynskikh, V. Kovinin, and graphic artists V. Kaidalov, K. Cheprakov. While their work is considered part of the golden heritage of Uzbek painting, their creative searches also reflect the spiritual concerns of their time. In their interpretation, the search for national identity was linked with national portrait types, genre scenes, and local landscapes. This interpretation of national identity was officially approved and manifested in various national schools. At the same time, there were also works of a different nature, addressing acute social issues—for example, N. Shin’s works on Stalinist repression and the genocide of the Korean people—which were excluded from the official art culture system.",
          "subtitle3": "Exhibition Theme: \"The search for new ideas and forms in the visual arts of Uzbekistan in the 1960s\"",
          "text4": "In the 1960s, there was a search for new forms of artistic generalization and the affirmation of entirely new plastic ideas. This period marked the emergence of a certain pluralism in artistic directions in Uzbek painting. The realist school continued to develop in the works of R. Akhmedov, V. Zhmakin, Z. Inogamov, M. Saidov, Yu. Elizarov, D. Imamov, V. Zorkin, L. Salimdjanova, Yu. Strelnikov, B. Tokmin, A. Baymatov, A. Rakhmatullav, Kh. Khusnitdinkhodjaev, K. Basharov, M. Kagarov, and others. With the formation of national art schools in the region, the issue of national identity in art gained new significance. This understanding encompassed not only the reflection of everyday life but also the expression of universal human values and a deep rethinking of traditional artistic heritage. This gave impetus to a renewed interest in decorative style as a continuation of centuries-old cultural traditions. This trend is reflected in the works of Ch. Akhmarov, N. Kashina, G. Ulko, R. Chariyev, V. Burmakin, Yu. Taldykin, E. Melnikov, R. Timurov, T. Pirmatov, A. Mirsagatov, N. Shin, and others."

The decorative trend is developed in the works of Sh. Abdurashidov, A. Mirzaev, R. Shadiev, R. Gagloeva, Yu. Taldykin, and E. Melnikov. At the same time, it should be noted that associative-metaphorical artistic thinking, becoming increasingly prominent, reveals its inner potential in the work of various artists, each reflecting their individual vision of the world and their specific painterly and plastic pursuits. Examples include the works of Dzh. Umarbekov, B. Dzhalalov, M. Tokhtaev, V. Akhunov, A. Isaev, I. Izentayev, and T. Mukhamedov.",

Rakhmanov, S. Rakhmanov, M. Tashmuradov, A. Yusupov, A. Yunusov, A. Khatamov, I. Vakhitov, A. Ponomarev, M. Sadykova, and others, acquiring a somewhat chamber or more decorative character. Generational continuity, deep spiritual searches, and reflection on the artistic achievements of the previous stage are also characteristic of the generation of Uzbek artists who entered or found their style in art in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the works of L. Ibragimov, A. Nur, G. Kadyrov, N. Imamov, M. Isanov, F. Akhmadaliev, B. Makhamov, Sh. Kuziyeva, and O. Kozokov, tradition is addressed not only as certain stylistic features, but also as a moral and spiritual connection to their homeland, people, culture, psychology, and mentality. At the same time, the avant-garde direction continues to develop in the works of A. Krikis; the creation of a personal, chamber world with a specific genre-thematic and stylistic focus distinguishes the search of I. Shin.",

            "text3": "In the 1990s, the achievements of previous stages in Uzbek painting continued to develop. The establishment of the Academy of Arts of Uzbekistan in 1997 played a significant role in energizing the artistic scene, elevating the status of the creative intelligentsia, promoting Uzbek visual art abroad, integrating it into the global cultural space, and supporting diverse artistic directions and styles in contemporary art. Alongside established and mid-career artists, new names of young painters emerged, representing and developing a wide range of creative directions: realism, decorativism, associative-metaphorical, avant-garde, and postmodernist approaches. Among them are: D. Ruzybaev, K. Norkhurazov, U. Urakov, N. Imamov, Dzh. Umarbekov, B. Dzhalalov, A. Mirzaev, L. Ibragimov, A. Nur, G. Abdurakhmanova, A. Allabergenov, V. Apukhtin, Dzh. Usmanov, A.

As early as the 4th–3rd centuries BCE, Seleucid and Greco-Bactrian coins circulated here, and from the beginning of the 3rd century BCE, the first locally minted coins began to appear in Sogdiana. Thus, the history of coinage in Uzbekistan spans more than 2,300 years. Its early stages are marked by Bactrian and Sogdian coins, while its present is reflected in the paper and metal currency of the Republic of Uzbekistan. Throughout this extensive period, coins of various denominations—copper, silver, and gold—were minted in the historical-cultural regions and ancient and medieval cities of Uzbekistan.",

It is known that the prominent 19th-century educator Ahmad Donish (1827–1897)—a poet, philosopher, calligrapher, and astronomer—also possessed artistic talent, as evidenced by his surviving drawings: the miniature \"The Poet and the Artist\" created for a manuscript edition of Abdulqadir Bedil’s \"The Four Elements\" and a satirical miniature depicting a mirshab, the city police chief. His miniatures are marked by precise, refined drawing, local color tones, a clear continuous contour line, and graphic style. His student, Abdulhalik-Mahmum, also gained recognition as a talented painter of insects and flowers.",

After completing his education, he returned to his homeland, where he not only worked as an artist but also taught at the Samarkand Art School until his death. In landscape painting, Bure focused on plein air studies. His architectural landscapes are notable for their true-to-life color and subtle use of color. He avoided cliché perspectives, always seeking fresh viewpoints on architectural monuments. The collection features three of his architectural landscapes: \"Lyabi-Khauz\" (1907), \"Courtyard of a Madrasa\" (1910), and the recently acquired \"Samarkand\" (1929), all painted in the artist’s beloved cities—Bukhara and Samarkand.",

A People's Artist of Uzbekistan, he was born in Fergana, studied at the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts, and taught at the Tashkent Art College.",
    "Alex_text2": "Volkov followed the traditions of Russian artists but was also influenced by French Cubism. He was passionately searching for his own style in painting. Volkov sought to combine the unique visual rhythm and rich coloration of the East with techniques of the \"Paris School\" of the early 20th century. According to his autobiography, from 1916 to 1928, the themes of his paintings included teahouses, camel caravans, and old city scenes, all interpreted through Cubist and Expressionist lenses.",
    "Alex_text3": "The painting \"Pomegranate Teahouse\", housed in the Tretyakov Gallery, was painted in 1924 during Volkov’s Cubist phase. In 1968, it was exhibited in Paris, receiving significant attention in the French press and coverage on French television.",
    "Alex_text4": "The painting \"Autumn Landscape\", held in the bank’s collection, was painted in 1931 in the Impressionist style. It demonstrates masterful use of complex gradations of color and light.",
    "Mumin_title": "Usto Mumin",
    "Mumin_text1": "Deeply inspired by ancient culture and the rich folk art of Central Asia was Alexander Vladimirovich Nikolaev—known in the history of Uzbek visual art as Usto Mumin (1897–1957). A student of K. Malevich, Usto Mumin came to Samarkand in 1921. He was captivated by the region’s magnificent architecture, decorative clothing, and jewelry. As he immersed himself in the local culture, he studied not only the art of folk craftsmen but also the legacy of classical Central Asian miniature painting. In 1925, he moved to Tashkent. A highly gifted artist and a major figure in both graphic and painting arts, he was deeply influenced by Uzbek folk culture and sought to fuse Italian and Russian artistic traditions with Uzbek visual heritage into a unified whole.",
    "Mumin_text2": "The bank’s collection includes his ink drawing \"Embroiderers\" from 1930.",
    "Fergana_title": "Great Fergana Canal",
    "Fergana_text1": "An artist whose creative work is similar in spirit to that of S. Yudin is Maksim Yevstafyevich Novikov (1886–1982). He graduated from the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts. Novikov entered the history of Uzbek visual art as a lyrical landscape painter and storyteller. The collection includes two of his paintings — \"Canal Construction\" and \"Tent City\" — in which he depicts the building of the Great Fergana Canal.",
    "Fergana_text2": "Many artists made sketches and studies during the construction of the Great Fergana Canal and the Chirchik Chemical Plant. Among them were Konstantin Pavlovich Cheprakov (1907–1972), a graduate of the Tashkent Painting Studio, and Aleksey Fyodorovich Podkovyrov (1889–1957), a graduate of the Penza Art School.",
    "Fergana_text3": "The most notable works in the collection are two portraits of leading builders — Nurnapasov and Sultanov (both from 1947). These portrait sketches by Cheprakov were drawn from life. With confident and expressive line work, the artist portrays typical representatives of that era.",
    "Fergana_text4": "A sketch by A. Podkovyrov titled \"Builders of the Fergana Canal\", created in 1939, represents another chapter in the history of Uzbekistan’s great construction projects.",
    "Graphics_title": "Development of Graphic Art",
    "Graphics_text1": "Graphic art in Uzbekistan began to develop with the spread of typography and book printing.",
    "Graphics_text2": "In the 1920s, artists such as L. Bure, M. Kurzin, V. Rozhdestvensky, A. Volkov, Usto Mumin (A. Nikolaev), and V. Eremyan were actively engaged in poster design and satirical magazine graphics.",
    "Graphics_text3": "Mikhail Ivanovich Kurzin (1888–1957) was a complex and intriguing figure in the painting and graphic art of Uzbekistan during the 1920s–1930s. He arrived in the republic in 1923 and settled in Tashkent. Kurzin received his professional education at the Kazan and Moscow Schools of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. Upon arriving in Tashkent, he became actively involved in the city’s artistic life, working as a theater set designer, contributing to newspapers, and teaching at an art studio.",
    "Ural_title": "Ural Tansykbaev",
    "Ural_text1": "The name of Ural Tansykbaev (1904–1974) first appeared in the Uzbek press in 1924. A newspaper reviewer, reporting on a local club exhibition, highlighted the remarkable talent of the young worker U. Tansykbaev. The article noted that his works revealed a desire to reflect national life, the nature of Turkestan, and a strong artistic sensibility. He portrayed village life with attention to detail and authenticity: yurts with their inhabitants, camel caravans, views of mountains and valleys. Tansykbaev's early works were primarily done in charcoal and pencil.",
    "Ural_text2": "He received his professional training first in Tashkent, and later at the Penza Art School.",
    "Ural_text3": "A master of epic landscape, Ural Tansykbaev considered nature an endless source of inspiration throughout his career. He constantly refined his approach, striving for expressive simplicity in his studies and compositions, and achieving a coloristic harmony that conveyed the poetic essence of landscape with depth and clarity. For this reason, critics referred to him as \"the leader of Uzbek colorists\".",
    "Nikolay_title": "Nikolai Georgievich Karakhan",
    "Nikolay_text": "Contemporary with A. Volkov and U. Tansykbaev, Nikolai Georgievich Karakhan (1900–1970) was a student of S. Yudin. Karakhan was captivated by the mountainous landscapes of Uzbekistan. In his studies and paintings, he developed themes related to the seasonal field work of rural laborers, varying motifs of spring and autumn, morning and evening, combining plein air technique and genre painting into a cohesive pictorial whole. He skillfully conveyed the sun-drenched state of nature.",
    "Shamsira_title": "Shamsira Khasanova",
    "Shamsira_text": "A student of A. Volkov and one of the first female artists in Uzbekistan, Shamsira Khasanova (1917–1956) is represented in the exhibition by a portrait of a vocational school student. Khasanova showed deep interest in historical themes, the lives of notable figures in science and culture, and her contemporaries. She made a significant contribution to the development of historical portraiture in Uzbekistan."

The exhibition “Women of Uzbekistan: Transformation” is a unique project that explores the multifaceted lives of women and their influence on society across different historical periods.",
      "text2": "In the 1920s, women removed the paranja as a symbol of lack of freedom and total dependence, marking the beginning of women's emancipation and laying the foundation for gender equality. Prominent educators of the time – M. Kori, M. Behbudi, A. Qodiriy, Kh. Niyoziy, A. Fitrat, and A. Chulpan – advocated for women’s rights and raised the issue of their education, recognizing that women are the ‘nurturers of the nation,’ and the future of the nation depends on their level of education. A campaign called ‘Hujum’ was later organized to remove the paranja and improve women's lives. While continuing to maintain their traditional role in the household, women also began actively participating in the country’s social and political life.",
      "text3": "The 20th-century history of Uzbekistan is full of remarkable women who played an important role in shaping modern society and proved their strength and dedication.",
      "text4": "Over the past century, the image of Uzbek women has gradually changed, and in just the last few years, their role and status in society have significantly grown. The independence of Uzbekistan marked a new and important chapter in women's lives, enhancing their status in public and political life. Under the leadership of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, women began holding important positions in the parliament, government, and local authorities. Furthermore, legal measures were adopted to protect women’s rights and to prevent discrimination and domestic violence.",

      "text1": "The earliest known photographic images of Turkestan were taken by chance in the Khanate of Khiva. The Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (Kunstkamera) of the Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg holds a photo album titled “Views and Types of the Khanate of Khiva.”",
      "text2": "Initially, the photographers documenting Turkestan were not of local origin. In the traditional mentality of the East, where Sharia law strongly discouraged depictions of living beings, portrait photography was considered unheard of. But in 1903, in New Urgench of the Khanate of Khiva, Khudaybergen Devonov founded his own photo studio. His work has attracted increasing attention from researchers studying the history of photography in Uzbekistan.",
      "text3": "Khudaybergen Devonov, the first Uzbek photographer and cinematographer, was born in 1879 in Khiva into the family of court secretary Nurmuhammad Devon, a close associate of the enlightened Khivan khan Sayyid Muhammad Rahim II.",
      "text4": "It happened that young, curious Khudaybergen once took part in a photo session held on the streets of Khiva by Wilhelm Penner, a Mennonite elder from a German settler village. Locals affectionately called him ‘Ponar-buva’ (Grandpa Lantern). Penner introduced the boy to the art of photography, including developing glass negatives and printing. The boy quickly learned the craft and began taking his own photos using a German camera – a ZOT – gifted to him by his teacher.",
      "text5": "Thus emerged the first native photographer in Central Asia, who would go on to become the founder of Uzbek photography and the country's first national cinematographer.",
      "text6": "Devonov’s early photographs were ethnographic in nature, filled with genuine love for his people and Khorezm's history – images of tightrope walkers by city walls, hunters with birds of prey, distinctive Khivan carts, and irrigation workers cleaning canals. His works show a blend of ethnographic documentation and artistic approach. This is visible even in his photographs of architectural landmarks. In terms of quality, Devonov’s early works are on par with those of his contemporary masters. Many of his prints feature Arabic-script annotations and dates made by the author himself, indicating that he began his creative photography as early as the 1890s.",
      "text7": "In the early 20th century, photographs were widely used for printing on postcards, which helped popularize this new art form. However, images of the Khanate of Khiva were rarely seen on such mass-produced items. The reason is that the main publisher of photo postcards in pre-revolutionary Russia was the Suvorin Agency, which had exclusive rights to sell postcards at all railway stations in the empire. As a result, even small towns along railway lines were depicted on postcards – but Khiva had no rail connection.",
      "text8": "Only in the 1920s–30s did large collections of photographs begin to appear, documenting the architecture, ethnography, and natural landscapes of the Khiva oasis. These were mostly taken by participants of various scientific expeditions to this remote region. Particularly notable are the many photographs from the famous Khorezm Expedition led by Professor S.P. Tolstov, which began in 1936 and continued for several years.",
      "text9": "Most of the popular images of Khorezm were taken in the postwar years, when the region rightfully earned the title of the country's ‘tourist Mecca.’ This became especially evident in the late 1990s, when Uzbekistan celebrated the 2500th anniversary of Khorezm. Today, beautifully published photo albums and books continue to convey the unique charm of Khiva, rightly called an open-air museum of architecture and ethnography."

      "text3": "The architectural landscapes of historic monuments created by the artist are unique — they embody the spirit of antiquity fused with modern artistic trends.",
      "text4": "Another distinctive feature of the artist is his curiosity. He doesn’t confine himself to a single style or genre. With each new work, he seeks to experiment with new techniques and approaches, always aiming for the best artistic solution.",
      "text5": "The artist travels extensively and translates his impressions, emotions, and experiences onto canvas. Umar is a highly observant artist who doesn’t want his art to merely decorate interiors — he aims to embed deeper meaning into every piece. Looking at his paintings, the viewer is drawn to explore and reflect on their meaning.",
